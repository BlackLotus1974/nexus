# Task ID: 23
# Title: Develop Warm Path Discovery Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: AI-powered algorithm to find best introduction paths to donors.
# Details:
1. Create lib/ai/warmpath.ts for path discovery logic.
2. Implement graph traversal for shortest warm path using relationships.
3. Score paths based on relationship strength at each step.
4. Generate introduction request templates with context.
5. Add warmpath discovery to AI orchestrator.
6. Create components/donor/WarmPathDisplay.tsx showing path visualization.
7. Create components/donor/RelationshipGraph.tsx (optional D3.js network graph).
8. Integrate with email generation for intro requests.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for path finding algorithm. Integration tests with sample relationship data. E2E tests for warm path UI.
