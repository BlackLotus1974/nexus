# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Project-Donor Alignment Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: AI-powered matching of donors to projects based on interests and giving patterns.
# Details:
1. Create lib/ai/alignment.ts for alignment scoring logic.
2. Analyze donor interests from intelligence_data JSONB field.
3. Match against project concept_note and description fields.
4. Generate alignment score (0-100) with detailed reasoning.
5. Store results in donor_project_alignments table.
6. Add analyzeProjectAlignment method to AI orchestrator.
7. Create Edge Function: project-alignment-generator.
8. Implement batch alignment calculation for new projects.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for alignment scoring algorithm. Integration tests with mock AI responses. E2E tests for alignment flow.
